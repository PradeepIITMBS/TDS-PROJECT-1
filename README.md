# GitHub Users in Singapore with Over 100 Followers

### Key Insights

- I used the GitHub API to scrape users located in Singapore with over 100 followers, as well as their repositories.
- The most interesting insight was that JavaScript and Python were the most commonly used programming languages among these users.
- Developers looking to gain visibility should consider creating more public repositories and engaging with open-source projects to increase their followers.

### Process

1. Fetched GitHub users located in Singapore with over 100 followers using the GitHub API.
2. For each user, fetched up to 500 of their most recently pushed repositories.
3. Cleaned the data and saved it into two CSV files: `users.csv` (user details) and `repositories.csv` (repository details).

### Files in This Repository

- **`users.csv`**: Contains details of GitHub users in Singapore with over 100 followers.
- **`repositories.csv`**: Contains details of the public repositories of these users.
